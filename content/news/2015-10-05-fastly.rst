We are happy to announce that Fastly_ has offered their worldwide CDN
network to provide fast download services for Linux kernel releases,
which should improve download speeds for those of you located outside
North America. We have modified the front page to offer CDN-powered
download links, but all the existing URLs should continue to work.

If you would like to avoid using the CDN, you can just substitute "cdn"
for "www" in the URL to get the tarball directly from kernel.org
servers. As always, please use `PGP Signature Verification`_ for all
files downloaded from kernel.org in order to make sure that the contents
have not been modified in transit.
