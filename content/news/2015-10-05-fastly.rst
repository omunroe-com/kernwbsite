We are happy to announce that Fastly_ has offered their worldwide CDN
network to provide fast download services for Linux kernel releases,
which should improve download speeds for those of you located outside
North America. We have modified the front page to offer CDN-powered
download links, but all the existing URLs should continue to work.

If you would like to avoid using Fastly, you can simply change the URL
to have "www.kernel.org" instead of "cdn.kernel.org". As always, please
use `PGP Signature Verification`_ for all downloaded files regardless of
where you got them.

.. _Fastly: https://fastly.com/
.. _`PGP Signature Verification`: https://kernel.org/signature.html
