We are extremely happy to announce that Packet_ has graciously donated
the new hardware systems providing read-only public access to the
kernel.org git repositories and the public website (git.kernel.org and
www.kernel.org, respectively). We have avoided using cloud providers in
the past due to security implications of sharing hypervisor memory with
external parties, but Packet's hardware-based single-tenant approach
satisfies our security requirements while taking over the burden of
setting up and managing the physical hardware in multiple worldwide
datacenters.

As of March 11, 2017, the four new public frontends are located in the
following geographical locations:

- San Jose, California, USA
- Parsippany, New Jersey, USA
- Amsterdam, Netherlands
- Tokyo, Japan

We have changed our DNS configuration to support GeoDNS, so your
requests should be routed to the frontend nearest to you.

Each Packet-hosted system is `significantly more powerful`_ than our
previous generation frontends and have triple the amount of available
RAM, so they should be a lot more responsive even when a lot of people
are cloning linux.git simultaneously.

Our special thanks to the following organizations who have graciously
donated hosting for the previous incarnation of kernel.org frontends:

- `Internet Systems Consortium`_
- Vexxhost_
- Tizen_

If you notice any problems with the new systems, please email
helpdesk@kernel.org.
