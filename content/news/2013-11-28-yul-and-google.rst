Montreal frontend
-----------------
We have added another official frontend for serving the kernel content,
courtesy of `Vexxhost, Inc`_. There is now a total of three frontends,
one in Palo Alto, California, one in Portland, Oregon, and one in
Montreal, Quebec. This should allow for better geographic dispersion of
official mirrors, as well as better fault tolerance.

TLS 1.2 and PFS
---------------
With the latest round of upgrades, we are now serving TLS 1.2 with PFS
across all kernel.org sites, offering higher protection against
eavesdropping.
