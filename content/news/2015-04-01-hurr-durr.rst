Hurr, Durr Im'a Sheep
=====================

:category: Site news

Linus named the upcoming 4.0 release of the kernel "Hurr Durr I'ma
Sheep" (see his `git commit`_), so we are celebrating this April Fool's
day with a minor prank. If you've been redirected to
`imasheep.hurrdurr.org`_, do not panic. It's all part of the joke.

We've also restored all FTP and Rsync access to the
`mirrors.kernel.org`_ servers, as we seem to have resolved our SSD
and dm_cache problems. If you're still using FTP, however, please
consider switching to HTTP. FTP is a protocol designed for a different
era -- these days everyone should be avoiding it for `multiple
reasons`_.
